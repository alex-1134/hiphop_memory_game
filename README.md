# Milestone Project 2: Interactive Frontend Development (HTML5 / CSS3 / JAVASCRIPT)

The aim of this project is to design and build a front-end interactive site that will respond to the user's actions.
The user should be able to engage with the data and alter the way that the information is displayed.


## Hip-Hop Memory Game

The idea for this project is a simple memory game. The user gets 16 cards (8 pairs) and has to match all the pairs. Once they find a pair, the pictures sta uncovered the board.

You can view the deployed game [here](https://alex-1134.github.io/memory_game_milestone/)


## User Experience (UX)

  * ### User Stories

    1. First Time Visitor Goals:

       a. First Time Visitors should be able to identify the purpose of the site by entering the landing page that is an          introduction to the game and also the theme of the game.

       b. A First Time Visitor should be able to easily navigate through the page to the game - by pressing the 'PLAY" button.

    2. Returning / Frequent Visitor Goals:

       a. A Returning Visitor knows what game it is and what theme to expect therefore chooses to return due to relaxing and quite simple nature of the game. 


* ### Design

    1. Colour Scheme:
       
       Pastel colours and black and white pictures to give the game an easy, relaxing vibe.

    2. Typography:

       Using Roboto font that is simple and easy to read but nicer than standard Times New Roman.

    3. Imagery:
       
       The game is aimed mainly at younger crowd that is interested in contemporary pop / hip-hop music. Musisians in the pictures are mainly new singers / rappers, but the user can also find some more old school performers from similar genres.

## Technologies used
  
  ### Languages used:

   * HTML
   * CSS
   * JAVASCRIPT

  ### Frameworks, Programs and Libraries Used:


## Code Testing

  All the code was tested for errors by the following code validators:

  * W3C
  * w3C CSS
  * JS

## Browser Compability Testing
  
   * The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer and Firefox browsres.

   * It was also viewed on different devices such as PCs, mobile phones, different models of iPhones, tablets, iPads and laptops.

   * Hyperlinks were tested to ensure that the user can enter the game.

   * Family and friends tested the game / reviewed the site to make sure the author did not miss any bugs or problems and that 
     the website is intuitive and easy to use / navigate through.

### Existing Bugs

  The website seems to be unresponsive for about 1 second after it is loaded.

  While writing the JavaScript code, there was a problem with the first click on the chosen image in the game - it had to be a double click. The issue has been solved. Another bug was that if user clicked fast on more than one photo - more than two cards were visible at the same time. That issue also has been fixed.

## Deployment

  The website was deployed on GitHub Pages. In order to do so, I logged into my GitHub account, found the repository (memory_game_milestone) and followed the deployment steps.

  In order to clone this project and run it locally: 
   * log into GitHub account (using Chrome) 
   * install Gitpod extensions for Chrome 
   * restart the browser
   * go to the project's repository
   * click on the green Gitpod button - this will open a new workspace that will enable to work on the code locally

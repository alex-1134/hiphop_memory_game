# Milestone Project: Interactive Frontend Development (HTML5 / CSS3 / JAVASCRIPT)

The aim of this project is to design and build a front-end interactive site that will respond to the user's actions.
The user should be able to engage with the data and alter the way that the information is displayed.


## Hip-hop Memory Game

The idea for this project is a simple memory game. The user gets 24 cards (12 pairs) and has to find all the pairs in the shortest time possible. Once they find a pair, the pictures are removed from the board.


## User Experience (UX)

  * ### User Stories

    1. First Time Visitor Goals:

       a. First Time Visitors should be able to identify the purpose of the site by entering the landing page that is an          introduction to the game and also the theme of the game.

       b. A First Time Visitor should be able to easily navigate through the page to the game - by pressing the 'PLAY" button.

    2. Returning / Frequent Visitor Goals:

       a. A Returning Visitor knows what game it is and what theme to expect therefore chooses to return due to relaxing and quite simple nature of the game.
